## Capstone Project: Build a Complete Website

This project is an addition to a previous hobby music website I created.  The website showcases the skills I have learned in the HyperionDev Bootcamp including HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  Using functions, loops, callbacks and many other components.  This website includes extra functionality for:

* Save For Later

* Adding comments
* Creating an additional folder page to view saved items
